Best coders: Library
===================

Simple project showing a set of public library classes and behaviors

http://codingsteve.github.io/docs/2015-09-26-library-project/

Basic functionality
-------------------

 - [Borrow][ITEM1] and [return][ITEM2] items - 
   items are loaned out for a period of one week. 
   For example, a customer can borrow WarGames on 21st February and they will be expected to return it by 28th February.
   

 - [Determine current inventory][ITEM3] - show the current items that are available for loan. We provide support for multiple copies of the same item (i.e. there can be multiple copies of the same book/movie).  
   
 - [Determine overdue items][ITEM4] - show all items that should have been returned before today. 
   For example, if a book was due on 12th February and today is 15th February, that book should be flagged as overdue.
