Best coders: Library
===================

Simple project showing a set of public library classes and behaviours

Basic functionality
-------------------

 - Borrow and return items - items are loaned out for a period of one week. 
   For example, a customer can borrow WarGames on 21st February and they will be expected to return it by 28th February.

 - Determine current inventory - this should show you the current items that are loanable. You should make allowances for multiple copies of the same item (i.e. there can be multiple copies of the same book/movie).  
   For example, if you choose to use the initial inventory, the current inventory should return the titles. 

 - Determine overdue items. i.e. all items that should have been returned before today. 
   For example, if a book was due on 12th February and today is 15th February, that book should be flagged as overdue.
